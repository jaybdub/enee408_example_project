Adding Code
-----------

First, read through the example programs.  This will help you create your own executable
code.  Next, you can read through the python / src folders to see some of the
reusable code we have written.

### Executable Code

It may help to separate your executable code (code that runs) from code that
may be reusable by different executables.  The examples folder contains executable
code.

#### Arduino
#### Cpp
#### Python

### Reusable Code

Reusable code is code that can be used by multiple programs, it may be useful to 
keep it separate from any specific program. Aside from 
the example programs, the code we have written for the course is re-usable.

#### Arduino
#### Cpp
#### Python
